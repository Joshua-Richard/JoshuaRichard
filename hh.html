                <p>
                    The problem was that ChatGpt only gave me a summary of what features the app would have,
                    Like storytellers say " Words on a page are nothing but words on a page, it is one's imagination that brings it to life".

            <div class="solution">
                <h1>solution</h1>
                <p>
                    My solution was fairly simple to use my imagination, unfortunately my imagination was running a bit wild.
                    I decided to research other health apps and the different styles and designs they would use.

                    I started by looking at some of the most popular health apps in order to get an idea of
                    how other apps were implementing some of these features and the design approach toward them.

                <p>
                    Using Adobe XD, I created a few low-fidelity wireframes. In which i added a few relevant stock images and information.
                    At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough for user testing. Based on testing,
                    Iâ€™ve made a few alternations and moved on to creating high-fidelity prototypes. 
                </p>
                <ul class="wireframe-list">
                    <li>I created both high and low-fidelity wireframes.</li>
                    <li>For creating my wireframes i used Adobe Xd, due to it being so easy to use.</li>
                    <li>Due to so many ways in which a single feature can be implemented, it took me roughly 4-5 iterations before i decided if it was useable or not.</li>

                <p>
                    Once the usability issues were resolved, i moved on to design the final screens in Adobe XD.
                    My goal was to create a visual identity that was aligned with the brand's values and message.
                     I've also checked other health apps and took a deep dive into my catalog of references for inspiration.

                    <li>
                        The visual style i was aiming for was that of a soft and calming look Because of the
                        app would be used by people looking to improve their health regularly. 
                    </li>
                    <li>the design was made for only mobile platforms.</li>
                    <li>The color scheme is mainly green because it gives off an impression of health and growth, As well as being known as a calming color.</li>
